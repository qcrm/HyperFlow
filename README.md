# HyperFlow

HyperFlow is a C++11-based open source research framework for the computation of two-dimensional numerical solutions to [hyperbolic conservation laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_partial_differential_equation#Hyperbolic_system_and_conservation_laws) via [high-resolution schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-resolution_scheme) implemented within the [finite volume method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_volume_method). 

Its primary application is conducting experiments for supersonic aerodynamics via numerical investigation of the compressible inviscid Euler equations on block-structured axis-aligned Cartesian grids.
